# Welcome to My Academic Portfolio

## 👤 About Me
I am a first-year PhD student at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC) advised by Prof. Minjia Zhang. My research focuses on high performance large-scale LLM training. 

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests span high-performance computing, machine learning systems, and GPU optimization. I focus on:
- Large-scale language model training and inference optimization
- GPU kernel performance prediction and optimization
- MLPerf benchmark implementations and HPC systems design
- Machine learning systems architecture
