## Key Takeaway: The Three Files

Your website is controlled by just **3 main files**:

### 1. `_config.yml` → Left Sidebar
```yaml
author:
  name: "Zixian Wang"        # Your name
  bio: "PhD student..."      # Short bio
  email: "email@..."         # Your email
  # (+ social profile URLs)
```

### 2. `_pages/about.md` → Main Content
```markdown
# Welcome to My Academic Portfolio

## About Me
Your about text...

## Research Interests
Your interests...
# (etc.)
```

### 3. `_data/navigation.yml` → Top Menu
```yaml
main:
  - title: "Publications"
    url: /publications/
  # (etc.)
```
